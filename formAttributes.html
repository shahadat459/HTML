    <h1>The Action Attribute</h1>
 <p>The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.<br>
    Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.<br>
    In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". <br>
    This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:</p>   
    <form action="/action_page.php">
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="Zeeshaan"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Khan"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
      </form> 
    <hr>
    <h1>The Method Attribute</h1>
<p>
    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.<br>
    The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").<br>
    The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. </p>
    <form action="/action_page.php" method="get"></form>
    <hr>
<p>
   <h1>Notes on GET:</h1> 

    Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs<br>
    NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)<br>
    The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)<br>
    Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result<br>
    GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google<br>
   
    <h1>Notes on POST:</h1>  
    Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)<br>
    POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.<br>
    Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked<br>
